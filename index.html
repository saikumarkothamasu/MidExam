                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.
                        Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
                        He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".

            <h1>Experiences</h1>
            <p><strong><em>Special Theory of Relativity, 1905 -</em></strong> Special relativity is an explanation of how speed affects mass, time and space.The theory is based on two postulates: 1. The laws of physics are invariant in all inertial frames of reference. 2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.The theory includes a way for the speed of light to define the relationship between energy and matter — small amounts of mass (m) can be interchangeable with enormous amounts of energy (E), as defined by the classic equation <strong>E = mc^2.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>General Theory of Relativity, 1916 - </em></strong>General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It says gravity is a curving or wraping of space. The more massive an object, the more it wraps the space around it.  </p>
            <p><strong><em>Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement, 1926 - </em></strong>This time, the subject was the kinetic theory of gases, but the paper was  groundbreaking in its conclusions.It says if tiny but visible particles were suspended in a liquid, the invisible atoms in the liquid would bombard the suspended particles and cause them to jiggle.This motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Why War?, 1933 - </em></strong>A letter to Sigmund Freud. Is there a way of freeing humankind from the threat of war? Can human aggression be channeled to help protect people against the impulses of hatred and destruction? These questions were put to Sigmund Freud in an anxious letter.</p>
            <p><strong><em>The Evolution of Physics, 1938 - </em></strong>he Growth of Ideas from the Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta. This book is incredibly insightful. It is a very conceptual book.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Out of My Later Years, 1950 - </em></strong>In this I gives my personal credos, my profound convictions on the most urgent questions of modern society: social, religious, educational and racial relationships, and the problem of peace.</p>
